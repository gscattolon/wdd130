      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of a lemonade stand is to educate our kids about Money, Marketing, Entrepreneurship, Finances, Customer Service, Goals, and most of all, they will learn to be responsible with money and how to have fun at the same time.
        During this process, we will teach our kids how much it cost to make the lemonade and how much we need to charge for it in order to make a profit.  We will be able to introduce them to how to do Marketing and Customer Service.  They will learn how to engage with the community and introduce our products and invite them to buy them.  
        Entrepreneurship is the foundation of our economy.  We will be teaching or kids what a business is and what it takes to make it work.  We will also be introducing our kids to use the math that they learn at school.  They will be doing money transactions with the customers, and they will be exposed to doing some easy math, figuring out how much to charge and how much change to give back.
        Finally, we will be learning about goals and how to reach them to have a prosperous business and through the whole process we will be learning about having fun while learning to be a businessperson.
        The lemonade stand is a great opportunity to teach our children the basic skills of running a business which will help them in their careers later in life.

      <h3>Lemonade & More</h3>
      <p>
        Lemonade stands are a classic summer experience and a great way to embrace the heat, but they can also teach your kids valuable skills.
It might be a big enough chore for a six-year-old just to sell cups of lemonade. However, with a little more experience and age, a young person might add foods that require no preparation or packaging.
Kids with or without help from the parents can be creative and create their own cakes, cookies, and other baked goods for a fraction of the cost of items you find at the store.  There are a lot of easy to prepare desserts like brownies, and Rice Krispies treats.  Older kids might have more experience baking and preparing treats and they can add more profit to the business.  Another idea would be to sell fresh fruit like bananas, strawberries, grapes, or any other seasonal fruit that can be found at a low price.  To make maximum profit, stand organizers should consider preparing the food themselves rather than purchasing prepackaged items.
