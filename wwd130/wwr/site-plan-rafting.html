    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of White Water Rafting is to help others make memories with loved ones.  Whether is friends or family, the goal is to have a blast.  There is no better way to bond with your family and friends, than by fighting colossal rapids and quite possibly saving each others butts from falling out of the boat? While you are rafting, you are spending all day, every day with your crew. I am talking breakfast, rapids. Lunch, rapids. Dinner, camp, and then possibly staring at the stars together before more rapids the next day. The point is, it is a lot of quality time with your friends (or family for that matter), and you are all probably in serious need of giving your texting relationship a big time out.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>In case you did not know, white water rafting can be one of the most adrenaline-pumping, thrill-seeking activities out there. From watching the horizon line disappear out of sight, signaling that you are about to drop 15 feet in 6 seconds, to paddling for your life through Class IV+ rapids, it is a wild ride. But you do not have to go that big to get the rush. No matter what size rapids you are tackling, you will definitely meet your summer excitement quota.</p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
